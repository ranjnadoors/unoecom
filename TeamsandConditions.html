            <h3>3. Your Account </h3>
            <p>
                You are entirely responsible for all materials and information that you upload, post or otherwise
                transmit via the Services (please also see our Acceptable Use Policy in Section 10). Only you may use

            </p>
            <h3>4. Email selected for your account </h3>
            <p>
                Your employer chooses what email address(es) you register for an account. The domain of the email
                address associated with your account is owned or controlled by your employer and your account will
                therefore be controlled by your employer. <br>

                Since your employer provided you with your account, your employer has rights to your account and may:
                (a) manage your account (including suspending or canceling); (b) reset your password; (c) view your
                usage and profile data, including how and when your account is used; and (d) manage the content in your
                account.

            </p>

            <h3>5. Consent to electronic communications and solicitation </h3>
            <p>
                By registering with UNOECOM or signing up for Services, you understand that we may send you (including
                via email) information regarding the Services, such as: (a) notices about your use of the Services,
                including notices of violations of use; (b) updates to the Services and new features or products; and
                (c) notifications from within the service. <br>
                Notices emailed to you will be considered given and received when the email is sent.
            </p>
            <h3> 6. Content </h3>
            <p>
                The content of the Service include: designs, text, graphics, images, video, information, logos, button
                icons, software, audio files, computer code, and other Company content (collectively, "Content"). All
                Content and the compilation (meaning the collection, arrangement, and assembly) of all Content are the
                property of UNOECOM or its licensors and are protected under copyright, trademark, and other laws. You
                agree to provide UNOECOM (as well as agents or service providers acting on UNOECOM's behalf to provide
                the Services) the right to transmit, process, use and disclose Content and other information which we
                may obtain as part of your use of the Services but only: (i) as necessary for us to provide the
                Services, (ii) as otherwise permitted by these Terms, (iii) as otherwise required by law, regulation or
                order, or (iv) to respond to an emergency.</p>
            <h3> 7. Confidential Information </h3>
            <p>
                During your use of the Services, UNOECOM may share with you information that is confidential, sensitive
                or should be kept secret. For example, if we tell you about our product roadmaps, product designs and
                architecture, technology and technical information, provide you with security audit reviews, business
                and marketing plans, or share with you our business processes, these should always be considered
                confidential to UNOECOM.<br>

                Also, if either of us provide any documents to the other that are labeled "confidential" (or something
                similar), or provide information (either in writing or verbal) that is of a type that a reasonable
                person should understand to be confidential such information is to be treated as confidential
                information. However, if you tell us information that: (a) we already know at the time you tell us; (b)
                was told to us by a third party who had the right to tell us; (c) is generally available to the public;
                or (d) was independently developed by us without using any of your confidential information, then that
                information will not be considered confidential. The same goes for information that we tell you that
                falls into any of these categories.<br>

                Lastly, we both agree that: (i) we will treat each other's information with the same degree of care that
                we treat our own confidential information; (ii) will use each other's confidential information only in
                connection with these Terms and the Services; (iii) only share the information with others who have a
                need to know and who have agreed in writing to treat it as confidential (as we've outlined in this
                section); and (iv) not share the information with any third party except as allowed in these Terms or
                through the Services. Of course, confidential information will always remain the property of its
                owner.<br>
                A subset of Unoecom Personnel has access to customer data as necessary to support the platform.
                Individual access is granted based on the role and job responsibilities of the individual. Access to
                systems containing customer data is reviewed on a regular basis and is monitored on an ongoing basis.
            </p> 
            <h3> 8. Content Storage </h3>
            <p>
                The Services are provided from the United States. By using and accessing the Services, you understand
                and agree to the storage of Content and any other personal information in the United States. However,
                you understand that you (or other people that you collaborate with) can access the Services (including
                Content) from outside of the United States (subject to applicable law) and that nothing prohibits the
                processing of other information outside of the United States.
            </p>
            <h3> 9. Acceptable use Policy </h3>
            <p>
                You agree you will not, nor will you encourage others or assist others, harm the Services or use the
                Services to harm others. For example, you must not use the Services to harm, threaten, or harass another
                person, organization and/or to build a similar service or website. You must not: (a) damage, disable,
                overburden, or impair the Service (or any network connected to the Services); (b) resell or redistribute

            <h3> 16. Dispute resolution and governing law </h3>

                UNOECOM will be governed by the laws of the State of California, U.S.A. regardless of conflict of laws
                principles. We both agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
                Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act does not apply to these Terms. We both agree
                that all of these claims can only be litigated in the federal or state courts in Santa Clara County,
                California, USA and we each agree to personal jurisdiction in those courts. However, you agree that
                UNOECOM can apply for injunctive remedies in any jurisdiction.
